                        Inspired by salt and vinegar potato chips, this hearty potato soup is both vegan and
                        budget-friendly. Most potato soups get their richness from cream or cheese; this version gets
                        its
                        creaminess from canned white beans and coconut milk. These mellow ingredients help create the
                        soup’s
                        silky texture and let the flavor of the potato and vinegar shine through. 1 large yellow onion

                    <p class="review-text">
                        Picked this up on a Steam sale for a great price so I'd have something different to play this
                        weekend, and it was perfect for a change of pace. It's primarily a stealth game with a few
                        puzzles,
                        all set in a dark, depressing plague-ridden Medieval France. The story takes a while to develop,
                        but
                        it's solid and enjoyable. The characters are well-voiced (and you can choose English, French or
                        German audio with English subtitles for more immersion). A Plague Tale in many ways reminded me
                        of
                        the old Thief games from the 90's, but with exceptional graphics and smarter AI. There's also a
                        touch of Tomb Raider here as well. <br>

                        It's refreshing to have a protagonist as a girl of about 15 who isn't sexualized or possessing
                        ungodly combat prowess. The majority of the game she is trying to avoid detection as well as
                        solving
                        a few puzzles, though she is able to take out some enemies from a distance with her sling. The
                        game
                        is very linear, but that's fine with me because it's all about the environment and the story. I
                        never found any situation so difficult that I couldn't progress after a couple of tries (until
                        the
                        very end, but it's a fun ending so I won't spoil it). <br>

                        Overall I would give it a 7/10, which in my opinion is a very respectable score. The only
                        negatives
                        I found are that the movement can be a bit clunky and a couple of times I found myself not
                        knowing
                        exactly what my objective was or where I was supposed to go - but those are minor. I completed
                        the
                        game in about 12-15 hours, and it has 16 unique chapters plus a very short epilogue after the
                        credits. As much as I enjoyed the dark environment and theme, and some very unique stealth
                        situations and puzzles, I'm not sure the game has a lot of replayability. But that's fine, since
                        games like this are meant to be experienced, not repeated over and over.

                    <p class="review-text">I was blown away by yet another masterpiece made by Tarsier Studios.
                        This game has more length, better graphics than it's first predecessor and they kept the
                        original
                        style that Little Nightmares always charmed for.
                        While the first little nightmares takes place in one environment which is the maw, Little
                        Nightmares
                        2 this takes place in various of areas.
                        In my opinion the game was of good length, it took me 7-8 hours to beat because I explored as
                        much
                        as I could, and took my time with my playthrough and did die a couple of times or got stuck in
                        some
                        parts but overall it's great.
                        The hat collectibles and finding all the Glitching kids was such a cool idea, it made exploring
                        all
                        the more worth it. On my 2nd playthrough already and got all the achievements which was so much
                        fun,
                        the secret achievements you need to get are so creative, I had to look up a guide to see how to
                        get
                        them.

                        The art team did an amazing job on this, the entire team did but the art department outdone
                        themselves, alot of work has been put into this game and I will look forward whenever Little
                        Nightmares 3 makes an appearance! :)

                        During my time with Genshin Impact, I fell in love with it. After only a few hours, my thoughts
                        about what this adventure was faded away as it truly evolves into a unique experience. There’s a
                        fine level of detail that went into crafting this beautiful world, and you can’t help but want
                        to
                        see every inch of it. Although the grind and the gachas systems are present, this is a game that
                        I
                        will gladly return to again and again. Regardless, all of this is available for free, so nothing
                        stops you from finding out for yourself.

                        Red Dead 2 is a masterpiece on so many levels. Rockstar games manage to out do themselves with
                        every
                        new title they release, which in hindsight seems completely impossible, for them however it's
                        just
                        challenge accepted and wait and see.
                        The Houser Brothers are militant geniuses, their childhoods have truly shaped them into the
                        gaming
                        pioneers they have so vehemently become. Their love for the cinematic experience and thirst for
                        havoc wreaking fun have truly illuminated Rockstar games as the gaming juggernauts that they are
                        and
                        as far as I'm concerned is unrivalled by any other developer who dare to produce a truly
                        inspiring
                        open world experience. Let's just thank that great big gamer in the sky for Rockstar games and
                        may
                        they live forever.

                        The legend of zelda breath of the wild easily no game has ever come with such a superb open
                        world
                        with mind blowing gameplay and creative puzzles. The amount of detail for a game which runs on
                        such
                        a low end console is just amazing. Even though the story isn't the best, it has probably one of
                        the
                        best introductions in a video game of all time. The atmosphere of the game is something which
                        only a
                        very few games have achieved with the story about how the kingdom of hyrule met destruction with
                        the
                        appearance of Gannon, it manages to tell of how it was destroyed with the very detailed but also
                        lifeless world. Botw is a game which can be considered a truly open world game with how much
                        freedom
                        you have in every single aspects except the shrines. The npcs are also very detailed and the
                        game's
                        difficulty is also well balanced. It was such a successful game that many game studios have
                        taken
                        inspiration from it and it has won the most number of game awards ever. It's a game which will
                        never
                        feel outdated because of how much it influenced the video game industry but also how much it
                        will
                        make an impact in the future.
